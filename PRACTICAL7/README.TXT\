Overview :

This practical focuses on applying statistical techniques — Regression with T-test, ANOVA, and Correlation — to analyze the Teachers’ Rating dataset.
The goal is to explore how factors like gender, age, and beauty scores influence teaching evaluation ratings.

Objectives :

Regression with T-test:
To determine whether gender affects the teaching evaluation scores of instructors.
Regression with ANOVA:
To examine whether the beauty score of instructors differs significantly across age groups.
Correlation Analysis:
To measure the relationship between teaching evaluation scores and beauty scores.

Methodology:

Used Python with libraries:
pandas, statsmodels, scipy, and seaborn.

Performed statistical testing on a teacher rating dataset (simulated version of the IBM “teacher evaluation” dataset).

Key steps:
Data cleaning and encoding (e.g., gender to numerical form)
Running OLS regression models
Conducting ANOVA tests
Calculating Pearson correlation coefficients
Interpreted results using p-values and correlation strength.
