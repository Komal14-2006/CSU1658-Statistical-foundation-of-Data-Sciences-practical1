## Statistical Foundation of Data Sciences – Practical Exercises

This repository contains Python-based practical exercises for the course Statistical Foundation of Data Sciences (CSU1658). The exercises focus on data manipulation, statistical analysis, and linear algebra using NumPy and pandas.

## Key Practicals Covered:
1.Synthetic Dataset Creation & Missing Values
     Generating random data with NaNs
     Computing mean, median, and weighted mean
2.Standardization & Outlier Detection
     Z-score computation for income
     Identifying outliers using |z| > 3
     Handling NaNs correctly
3.Age Binning & Aggregation
     Grouping by age bins: [18–25), [25–35), [35–45), [45–60)
     Computing count, mean, median for each bin
     Displaying results in a tidy DataFrame
4.NumPy Array Operations & Linear Algebra
     Array shape, size, transpose, flatten
     Negative indexing & slicing error demonstration
     Broadcasting and dot product
     Determinant and inverse of matrices

## Tools Used:
Python 3
NumPy
pandas
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Purpose:
